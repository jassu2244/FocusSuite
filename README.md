**An intelligent desktop productivity tool to eliminate distractions and streamline video editing.**

</div>

FocusSuite is a Python-based desktop application designed to help users maintain focus. It has two main features:

1. **Focus Monitor**: It actively watches your screen, using AI to identify and obscure distracting text in real-time.
2. **Focus Video**: It processes video files, automatically blurring elements based on a simple descriptive prompt you provide.

## Key Features ‚ú®

### Focus Monitor (Distraction Blocker)
* **Real-time Screen Analysis**: Employs **Tesseract OCR** to extract on-screen text for analysis.
* **Intelligent Obscuring**: Uses **OpenAI's gpt-4o** (or a local LLM alternative) to intelligently find and blur distracting content.
* **Efficient Performance**: A smart monitoring loop uses **SSIM image comparison** to detect screen changes, preventing redundant analysis and saving system resources.

### Focus Video (Automated Blurring)
* **Prompt-Based Editing**: Simply describe what you want blurred, and FocusSuite handles the rest.
* **Flicker-Free Results**: It generates a definitive **"blur timeline"** after analyzing keyframes, ensuring the blur is smooth and consistent without the flickering common in frame-by-frame AI analysis.
* **Audio Preservation**: The original audio track is perfectly preserved and re-attached to the final edited video using **MoviePy**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get FocusSuite running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
* **Python 3.9+**
* **Tesseract OCR**
* **FFmpeg**

### Installation & Configuration
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/FocusSuite.git
    cd FocusSuite
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This will install all necessary packages like `openai`, `opencv-python`, `moviepy`, and others.

3.  **Configure your environment variables:**
    * Create a copy of the example environment file and name it `.env`:
        ```sh
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    * Open the new `.env` file and add your secret API keys and URLs.

### Running the Application
Once the installation and configuration are complete, you can start the application with:
```sh
python FocusSuite/main.py
```

## Architecture Highlights üèóÔ∏è
This project is built on a foundation of clean, maintainable code principles.

- **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**: The application is strictly modularized. The UI (`ui/`), core logic (`core/`), and external API communication (`api/`) are completely decoupled, making the system easy to scale and test.
- **Callback-Driven UI**: The core application logic is headless and has no direct knowledge of the UI. It communicates with the Tkinter front-end via a dictionary of callback functions, meaning the user interface can be completely replaced without affecting the backend.
- **Encapsulated Feature Managers**: Each major feature is orchestrated by a dedicated manager (e.g., `FocusMonitorManager`, `VideoFeatureManager`). The main `app.py` orchestrator simply delegates tasks, keeping the central logic clean and readable.
